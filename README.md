A programming language I'm starting. I wrote a parser as another project:
https://github.com/jackcasey067/Parsley, and I'm using this as an excuse to test
it.

I don't know what makes Nom special yet, if anything. Right now, I am hoping for
a statically typed language (mostly because I like them and think type systems are 
cool), but likely it will be interpretted because interpretted is easy. I shouldn't
rule out some sort of compile to bytecode approach though - that could be a middle
ground between learning about compilation and optimization techniques versus actually
having to deal with putting together binaries.
