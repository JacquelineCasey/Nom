Planning takes place on this project: https://github.com/users/jackcasey067/projects/1/views/1

The shortest of short term items (i.e, tasks necessary to complete the next goal) 
can go here:

== Immediate TODO ==
- If statement type checking (condition must be bool, body must match expected)

- Q: Can if statements ignore the semicolon? What about standard block expressions? Will this create grammar ambiguity?
