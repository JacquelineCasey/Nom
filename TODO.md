Planning takes place on this project: https://github.com/users/jackcasey067/projects/1/views/1

The shortest of short term items (i.e, tasks necessary to complete the next goal) 
can go here:

== Immediate TODO ==

- Document the language in nom_docs.md
- Document the project in the code itself.
  - Top level done. More to follow.
- Add Span Annotation function somewhere in error code. Errors should print out some code and underline relevant bits.
