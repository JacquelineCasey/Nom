Planning takes place on this project: https://github.com/users/jackcasey067/projects/1/views/1

The shortest of short term items (i.e, tasks necessary to complete the next goal) 
can go here:

== Immediate TODO ==

-[x] Update generation code to do struct expressions (and assignment for non-int sized types)

-[] Member access parsing is too forgiving. Should require second part (right of .) to be
    an identifier.

- [] Define struct member access syntax
  - [] Implement syntax

- Test nesting? Struct in a struct?
